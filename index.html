# Storing data on the Ethereum Blockchain

```python
>>> byte_storage_cost = 200
>>> byte_in_transaction_cost = 68
>>> transaction_cost = 21000
>>> one_cent_in_gas = 50000
>>> (268 * 100000 + 21000) / 50000
5360.42
```

--

=> 1 Megabyte is ~50â‚¬

---

# Storing data II

* Even if you are willing to pay the price, gaslimit is currently at ~4Mio.
(1MB tx consumes ~268Mio gas)

--

### Thus data will be stored off-chain

---

# Issues

* Avoid data loss by having multiple nodes store it

--

* What is the incentive of the node to store private documents of strangers?

???
Private tracker

---

# Alternatives

* Filecoin: Positive incentivisation only

--

* IPFS: incentivisiation not built-in

--

* Zeronet: Not fast/responsive enough (???)

???

In Filecoin you don't lose anything if you lose the data. Only future earnings.

# ENS (Ethereum Name Service)

* Provide human readable name for resource.

--

* Contracts can contact name instead of address. Thus the underlying contract can be replaced with an updated version.

--

* Allow changing the content without changing the URL

---

# Example

```javascript
{
  [...]
  "stuttgart.eth": {
    "content": "0xdb3083055c72ea2528902aae0ff8...",
    "owner": "0xa8c193055c72ea2528902aae0fe9..."
  },
  "meetup.eth": {
    "content": "0x6eaf6c1191b090631668ad8db7dd...",
    "owner": "0x864c51dd13443614d0ff6949a3ba..."
  },
  [...]
}
```

# Demo

# SWAP (Swarm Accounting Protocol)

* Nodes are rewarded for successfully serving data

--

* Micropayment per piece of data

--

* Balances out in the best case because your node is serving data too

--

* Requires Payment-Channel Network [Raiden Network](http://raiden.network/) which is not ready

---

> Unpopular chunks that do not generate sufficient profit from retrievals should compensate the nodes that store them for their opportunities forgone.

---

# SWEAR (Secure Ways of Ensuring ARchival)

* Owner of data may purchase storage promises from other nodes as form of insurance
* Storer sends deposit to SWEAR contract, serving as collateral in case data is not kept

---

# SWINDLE (Secured With INsurance Deposit Litigation and Escrow)

Proving to any third-party that you store a blob of data without transferring the whole data and without revealing the actual contents. (Proof-of-custody)
